# Comparative-Analysis-of-Phishing-Email-Classifiers
In an age where digital communication is the lifeblood of modern society, the battle against
email-based threats such as spam, phishing, and their ilk rages on. While email providers like
Outlook and Gmail employ algorithms to filter unwanted messages, false positives remain an
enduring challenge. Consider, for instance, legitimate emails from educational institutions with
essential links, unjustly relegated to the spam folder. The core objective of our project is to
advance the state of email classification by meticulously categorizing incoming emails as ”safe”
or ”phishing” while minimizing false positives. We aim to achieve this by extracting language
features and computing the similarity between safe and unsafe emails. Our possible future work
is to study the causes of a target falling for a phishing attack through an empirical study. Our
present approach includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pre-processing, computing the
similarity score, and extracting language features using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques. Using these features, we will train and test three classifiers - Random Forest,
Support Vector, and XGBoost - and present our findings through four experiments to highlight
the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
